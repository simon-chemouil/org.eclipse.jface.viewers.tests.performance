This bundle adds two views to any Eclipse application, however
these views are not added to any perspective by defautl.

To display them, use the Show Views menu item or the command shortcut
(Shift Alt Q Q).

The views are displaying the same underlying model which contains 10000
elements under a single node but one of them has an ILazyTreeContentProvider
while the other thas a ITreeContentProvider.

The behavior of both views works as expected under GNU/Linux (GTK backend),
that is that the LazyView node is quicker to expand, but the scrollbar feels
very lightly slower, and the standard content provider takes time to open
the node, but the scrollbar feels very light since all the TreeItems are in
memory.

However, the bug happens on Windows (tested on Windows XP) for both 
content providers.
 * The ILazyTreeContent provider is completely unusable, first there is a
refresh bug when expanding the node (the tree view becomes blank), then
the scrollbar feels extremely heavy and unusable.
 * The scrollbar problem is resolved using an ITreeContentProvider.
 * With both content providers, the selection of an element or navigating
using keyboards arrows is very sluggish and seems to "lag" behind user actions.


I have been unable to identify the source of the problem (mainly because I
don't know JFace/SWT internals well enough), but having this fixed would be
great.
